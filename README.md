# Itemstore-Checker
Just one of my GMod addons that will check a player's Itemstore inventory.

This add-on is made by me and has a config in init.lua

==FAQ==
1. HELP I CAN'T FIND IT IN-GAME!!!!!
- It's named 'Seizing SWEP' in the "other" category for realism.

2. I'm having bugs, errors, issues!!!!
- You should post a comment here or make a discussion about it :), I will most likely resolve it.
